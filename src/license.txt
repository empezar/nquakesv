Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. 

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. 

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. 

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. 

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. 

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. 

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you". 

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 


a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. 

c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. 

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. 

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. 

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 


END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

SHAREWARE VERSION: QUAKE
LIMITED USE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

        This Limited Use Software License Agreement (the "Agreement") is a
        legal agreement between you, the end-user, and id Software, Inc.
        ("ID").  By continuing the installation of this game program, by
        loading or running the game, or by placing or copying the game
        program onto your computer hard drive, you are agreeing to be bound
        by the terms of this Agreement.

ID SOFTWARE LICENSE

        1.      Grant of License.  ID grants to you the limited right to use
        one (1) copy of the enclosed or foregoing Id Software game program
        (the "Software"), which is the shareware version or episode one of
        the game program.  For purposes of this section, "use" means loading
        the Software into RAM, as well as installation on a hard disk or
        other storage device. You agree that the Software will not be
        shipped, transferred or exported into any country in violation of
        the U.S. Export Administration Act (or any other law governing such
        matters) and that you will not utilize, in any other manner, the
        Software in violation of any applicable law.

        2.      Commercial Use is Prohibited.  Under no circumstances shall
        you, the end-user, be permitted, allowed or authorized to
        commercially exploit the Software, or any portion thereof, such 
	as a screen display or a screenshot.  Neither you nor anyone at your
        direction shall do any of the following acts:

        a.      Rent the Software;

        b.      Sell the Software;

        c.      Lease or lend the Software;

        d.      Offer the Software on a pay-per-play basis;

        e.      Distribute the Software for money or any other
                consideration; or 

        f.      In any other manner and through any medium
                whatsoever commercially exploit the Software or use
                the Software for any commercial purpose. 

        3.      Additional Prohibited Uses.  Neither you, nor anyone at your
        direction, shall take the following action in regard to the
        Software, or any portion thereof, such as a screen display or 
	a screenshot:

        a.      Modify, disassemble, reverse engineer or decompile
                the Software; 

        b.      Translate the Software;

        c.      Reproduce the Software;

        d.      Publicly display the Software; or

        e.      Prepare derivative works based upon the Software.

	4.	Use of Other Material is Prohibited.  Use, in any manner, of 
	the trademarks, such as Quake(tm) and the NIN(r) logo, logos, symbols, 
	art work, images, screen displays or screenshots, sound effects, music, 
	and other such material contained within, generated by or relating to 
	the Software is prohibited.

	5.      Restrictions Apply to Third Parties.  The prohibitions and
        restrictions described herein apply to anyone in possession of 
	the Software.

        6.      Permitted Distribution. So long as this Agreement
        accompanies the Software at all times, ID grants to Providers the
        limited right to distribute, free of charge, except normal access
        fees, and by electronic means only, the Software; provided, however,
        the Software must be so electronically distributed only in a
        compressed format. The term "Providers," as used in the foregoing
        sentence, shall mean persons whose business it is to provide
        services on the Internet, on commercial online networks, or on the
        BBS. Anyone who receives the Software from a Provider shall be
        limited to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Further,
        ID grants to you, the end-user, the limited right to distribute,
        free of charge only, the Software as a whole.

        7.      Copyright. The Software is owned by ID and is protected by
        United States copyright laws and international treaty provisions.
        You must treat the Software like any other copyrighted material,
        except that you may make copies of the Software to give to other
        persons. You may not charge or receive any consideration from any
        other person for the receipt or use of the Software. You agree to
        use your best efforts to see that any user of the Software licensed
        hereunder complies with this Agreement.

        8.      Limited Warranty. ID warrants that if properly installed and
        operated on a computer for which it is designed, the Software will
        perform substantially in accordance with its designed purpose for a
        period of ninety (90) days from the date the Software is first
        obtained by an end-user. ID's entire liability and your exclusive
        remedy shall be, at ID's option, either (a) return of the retail
        price paid, if any, or (b) repair or replacement of the Software
        that does not meet ID's Limited Warranty. To make a warranty claim,
        return the Software to the point of purchase, accompanied by proof
        of purchase, your name, your address, and a statement of defect, or
        return the Software with the above information to ID.  This Limited
        Warranty is void if failure of the Software has resulted in whole
        or in part from accident, abuse, misapplication or violation of this
        Agreement. Any replacement Software will be warranted for the
        remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days,
        whichever is longer. This warranty allocates risks of product
        failure between Licensee and ID. ID's product pricing reflects this
        allocation of risk and the limitations of liability contained in
        this warranty.

        9.      NO OTHER WARRANTIES. ID DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER  WARRANTIES,
        EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED
        WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A pARTICULAR PURPOSE
        WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND THE ACCOMPANYING WRITTEN MATERIALS,
        IF ANY. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU
        MAY HAVE OTHERS WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ID
        DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE
        UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE OR MEET LICENSEE'S SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.
        THE WARRANTY SET FORTH ABOVE IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER EXPRESS
        WARRANTIES WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN. THE AGENTS, EMPLOYEES,
        DISTRIBUTORS, AND DEALERS OF ID ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO MAKE
        MODIFICATIONS TO THIS WARRANTY, OR ADDITIONAL WARRANTIES ON BEHALF
        OF ID. ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS SUCH AS DEALER ADVERTISING OR
        PRESENTATIONS, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, DO NOT CONSTITUTE WARRANTIES
        BY ID AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON.

        10.      Exclusive Remedies. You agree that your exclusive remedy
        against ID, its affiliates, contractors, suppliers, and agents for
        loss or damage caused by any defect or failure in the Software
        regardless of the form of action, whether in contract,tort,
        including negligence, strict liability or otherwise, shall be the
        return of the retail purchase price paid, if any, or replacement of
        the Software. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
        and governed by the laws of the State of Texas. Copyright and other
        proprietary matters will be governed by United States laws and
        international treaties. IN ANY CASE, ID SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR LOSS
        OF DATA, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
        CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES ARISING FROM BREACH
        OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY
        EVEN IF ID OR ITS AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
        DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY. Some jurisdictions do
        not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
        damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.

        11.     General Provisions. Neither this Agreement nor any part or
        portion hereof shall be assigned or sublicensed, except as described
        herein. Should any provision of this Agreement be held to be void,
        invalid, unenforceable or illegal by a court, the validity and
        enforceability of the other provisions shall not be affected thereby. 
	If any provision is determined to be unenforceable, you agree to a 
	modification of such provision to provide for enforcement of the 
	provision's intent, to the extent permitted by applicable law.  Failure 
	of a party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not 
	constitute or be construed as a waiver of such provision or of the 
	right to enforce such provision. If you fail to comply with any terms 
	of this Agreement, YOUR LICENSE IS AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATED.

        YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, YOU UNDERSTAND
        THIS AGREEMENT, AND UNDERSTAND THAT BY CONTINUING THE INSTALLATION
        OF THE SOFTWARE, BY LOADING OR RUNNING THE SOFTWARE, OR BY PLACING
        OR COPYING THE SOFTWARE ONTO YOUR COMPUTER HARD DRIVE, YOU AGREE TO
        BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT'S TERMS AND CONDITIONS. YOU FURTHER
        AGREE THAT, EXCEPT FOR WRITTEN SEPARATE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN ID AND
        YOU, THIS AGREEMENT IS A COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT OF THE
        RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES OF THE PARTIES. THIS AGREEMENT SUPERSEDES
        ALL PRIOR ORAL AGREEMENTS, PROPOSALS OR UNDERSTANDINGS, AND ANY
        OTHER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN ID AND YOU RELATING TO THE SUBJECT
        MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT.
